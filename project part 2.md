One of the most important things I value is family. Like every family, mine is unique. I grew up with one older brother and two younger sisters. After the youngest one was born, my mother got her tubes tied, but little did we know that would not work. At the age of 59, my mother was pregnant. Due to her age, this was a high-risk pregnancy, and the doctors did not expect it to be successful. My mother ended up getting preeclampsia 27 weeks into her pregnancy. Her life was at risk, and the only two choices were to remove the baby early or let the baby suffocate inside the womb. My other took the chances of delivering the baby early, and he was successfully retrieved, weighing only two pounds. His body was so small that most of his organs were not fully developed. Due to this, he had to stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unity (NICU) for five months.
Throughout this time, the doctors explained that he would develop differently than most children. He is expected to catch up to children in his age group by the time he hits four. He learned to crawl, walk, and eat later than most. He does not speak but communicates through various tones such as screaming, screeching, and grunting. There are many children like my brother who are born too early or, for different reasons, struggle with speech. My project is for those who do not have the voice to communicate. It is for children who struggle to get their needs and wants across with words. Although speech therapy exists, this program will be an extra tool for families and doctors.


The idea I have for this project is to combine voice stress analysis with a family-friendly user interface. There is a vast amount of data that will be needed before creating this device. First, and most importantly, is the patient. Since no child is alike, the program will require medical data such as physical information, conditions or diagnoses, allergies, and family history. Together, the doctor, along with the family, will help create a baseline for the child. This information will help create a treatment plan for each patient. It will also help create a timeline of when the child should be making progress. In theory, the device will keep track of any anomalies that occur in the child's development. For example, if the child begins to hum or say a new word, the device will record this and forward that information to the doctor. CVSA, or computer voice stress analyzers, are housed in ruggedized DellÂ® hardware, with a comprehensive 4-year hardware warranty included in the purchase price. Since the CVSA III is now classified as an instrument, it will require particular legal work to try and purchase one for this project. In the meantime, I can work on building the user interface.

The interface for this project will be an application with two different databases and hence two various portals. There would be one for the parent and another for the doctor. The interface would streamline all the data into one application. Upon opening the application (website), the end-user would be prompted to either sign in or register. This application will be strictly for medical purposes. In order to enforce this, I would have certain data already in the database, such as hospitals and doctors. As the user fills out the registration form, they will have certain areas where a drop-down box is an option rather than a fill-in text box. Those that populate in the drop-down menu would be hospitals, insurance companies, and doctors. This is because I want to enforce the best practices for medical privacy. The people who enter the database are those who have legally agreed to abide by all HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act) laws, signed paperwork ahead time, and agreed to participate in this program. All medical staff will be entered into a server that sends their user profile and accounts information to a different server. The family and the medical staff will be matched based on the social security of the patient. The users will also need to verify and update whether the medical staff's information is accurate every 15 days. It will be a simple pop up message. This will help protect both patients and doctors. It will also prevent violation of any HIPAA laws. Along with the application with the portals and databases, comes a voice stress recorder. This voice stress recorder will use voice stress analysis and will be in the tangible form of a small block that looks like a speaker. It will have an on and off button and will use a USB cable to charge. I want it to be tangible so it can be placed in a playroom, bedroom, or car when necessary. Eventually, I would like to turn that device into something comfortable that the child can wear. It would be a harness or strap that can be discreetly worn under clothing. It would have the microphone and program embedded into a chip inside the cloth. Overall, I want the user interface to be simple but also very secure. I understand that this program requires a lot of complex programming.

The programming for this project may have to involve more than one language. Through my research, I found that python has programming available for speech recognition. I want the program to be able to record a baseline of different tones, screeches, and pitches. This will be done through voice stress analysis. Voice stress analysis uses non-verbal and low-frequency content of the voice to convey physiological states. This is important because if the child is in danger or stressed out, the program will be able to alert the parent. Modern technologies that utilize voice stress analysis utilize different algorithms to analyze and measure the effects of stress in the human voice. This program is already built and utilized by police departments, federal agencies, and other investigators. Because the program already exists, it would need to be modified to cater to children. For example, it would need to have a baseline of child stress, such as crying and screaming. This is the program that would be mounted into a chip and put into a microphone device. The device will be a portable block that looks like a small speaker. The information in this will then be pushed forward to the Speech Analysis Application made specifically for medical staff and patients. All medical staff will be entered into a server that sends their user profile and account information to a different database. This means when a doctor logs in, he will be able to see different information than the patient's family will see. This is so the doctor can input notes and analyze the information the machine collected. Any alerts the machine pushes forward due to anomalies in the child's development will be pushed forward to the server that the doctor's account is on. From there, the doctor will be able to make notes or set up appointments with the patient. He will be able to make private notes and notes that the family can see. I would need to program the notes to push forward to the patient's portal so that the parents can see what the doctor says.

This project involves multiple parts. In order to proceed with the project, I would need the source code for the CVSA. However, legally, this requires time and a lot of work. In the meantime, I can work on the user interface.
