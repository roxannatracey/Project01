#### USE CASE: Application for Nonverbal children
##### Actors
Doctor

##### Trigger
The Doctor indicates that a child is showing signs of speech delay. The doctors are not ready to make a diagnosis. The doctor wants to be able to monitor any anomalies in the patient's communication attempts.
##### Precondition "app must have data to do actors goal"
The application must be able to analyze the Patient's heart rate, voice frequency, and breathing so that information can be relayed back to the doctor.
##### Post-condition "user will have met their goal"
The Doctor will be able to communicate better with the parent and Patient.

##### Normal Flow "steps"
1. The user indicates that they are part of a medical staff
2. The user will make an account if they don't have one
3. The user will log in
4. The user will be presented with form to fill out
5. The user will submit the form
6. The system will prompt the user to confirm all information is correct
7. The user will be presented with a live feed of the patient's heart rate and frequency sound waves. A baseline will be shown
8. The user can then select a link to make notes that will then relay back to the patient's caregiver's portal
9. The system will prompt the user to confirm that the notes are complete
10. The user will be able to view any appointments requested by the patient's caregiver
11. The user will either confirm or decline the request appointments
12. The system will send a confirmation email and notification to the caregiver
13. The user will exit the system

##### Alternate Flow "if changes need to be made"
A. The user changes their mind, and wants to cancel the appointment
  1. The user requests the appointment be canceled
  2. The system will prompt that this is correct
  3. The user will confirm
  4. The use case ends
